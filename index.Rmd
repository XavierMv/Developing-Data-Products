## Leaflet

In this project I will use the Ameshousig library to generate different point in a leaflet map and create some clusters out of them, the markers will be labeled with the name of the Neighborhood they belong to.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
h <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
attach(h)
map <- h %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat = Latitude, lng = Longitude, popup = "Ames", label = Neighborhood, clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
map
```
